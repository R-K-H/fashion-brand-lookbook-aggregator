# Centralized Lookbook Store
Placeholder for a concept I'm working on for aggregating the brand lookbooks for fashion companies. See the sections below for a better understanding of what this is or could be.

## Motivation
My partner works for a magazine which shoots fashion. She is required to make requests of brands and public relation companies to solicit the lookbooks from specific brands for specific shows. It seems like something which is quite common for the industry. 

There are several issues faced with this currently, one is point of contact for each brand is cumbersome, there are several tools, one of which is Fashionmonitor.com, however it has been reported that their information is maybe 50% accurate for contact, therefore it is advised to contact through the website or email located in the terms and conditions on the website of the brand.

Second is there does not seem to be a central repository for lookbooks, unless there is some reason for restricting this, I think it should be provided either as a service, which a company would pay to access (as it looks like a manual job) which would allow you to download the required lookbook(s) or as something which would aggregate programatically (although it looks like brands might be slow to publish online). This seems like it would be easily absorbed by the business as a cost, as currently these requests are done by a team memeber.

The problem is timing, point of contact and then the actual files (it seems they can be quite large). In the end all the business wants to do is make requests of the brand or PR to get the items in a look to the business for a photo shoot. Currently the method is taking the shows from Vogue.com or other fashion shows aggregating the brands you think you'd want in a shoot, then having someone take that brand list then requesting them to get lookbooks, that person in turn has to identify the point of contact for the brand (may be online or through a PR), then sending a request to the brand (or PR), then following up or waiting for them to send the file (sometimes it's too large for email so sent using wetransfer or something else).

This seems like a lot of steps for something the brand and businesses that work in fashion do quite frequently and have team memebers entirely responsible for this process. Ideally if a business was to spring up with all of this done for them it could speed up the process for aggregating and then the next steps would be to bridge directly and have the decision makers simply be able to request directly from looking online. Eg. I'm shooting for X magazine on Y date and we would like the items from Z look in Fall 2019 lookbook. At the end of the day it seems like something which should be simple as at the end of the day it's up to the brand (or PR) to determine if the brand wants the exposure offered by the requestor.

## ToDo
- Identify brands
- Research contact methods
- Review online accessable content
- Lookbook formatting
- Research breaking up lookbooks (PDF scraping)
- How to make a request for a look
- What kind of info a brand (or PR) needs of a business (to determine if they want to comply)
- Storage and search for looks / lookbooks

## Concept
Login to a web application which would allow you to search for brands, shows (Fall 2019), lookbooks (if special), looks, color, style, gender, etc. You would be required to create a profile for the business which would inculde important information for brands as well have the ability for a business manager to assign users to the business (if large). This application is maintained by a team of people submitting requests or eventually all brands would simply login and upload their lookbooks and information as it's a tool for them as well. The system would organize and make these lookbooks available, as well we would break up the lookbooks into each individual look so that a person searching could search and create their own "scrapbook" of looks they think they might like. Then when they are done it would structure it as a request and then it would submit to each brand (or PR) as appropriate for the requested items / looks.

Users would be brands, PRs or businesses (or business employees or representatives) each would have their own functions in the system a bit different, but with the end goal for the brand of promotion of the brand and for the businesses whatever their primary function is, for the example I've been thinking of it would be for photo shoots.
